<h1>GameObject</h1>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>This script defines the basis of what a game object is. 
    Properties such as gravity, collision and so on are applied here. 
    This is a very powerful concept, as it allows you to craft game objects 
    with a large degree of control. For example, maybe you have to have the 
    player interact with all of the crates in the game; or that you want all 
    coins to interact with players.</p>
     
<p>While these are simple, irrefutable concepts in any game, 
    the functions contained within the GameObject class allow a 
    statement to become the golden rule, instead of requiring you 
    to write tedious code</p>

<p>Along side of the GameObject class are some key offspring classes. 
    Particularly there are two classes that are necessary for most games - Player and NPC</p>

<h3>Functions</h3>
<div class="code-block">
    <code class="prettyprint"><h4>constructor(name:string, type:string, imageFile:string)</h4></code>
    <p>Creates the game object. Requires a name and type keys and file name of an image to render.</p>
    <p>"name" and "type" are arbitrary - 
    these are for various systems to use so they can 
    interact with game objects -- either an individual 
    game object or all particular game objects (such as all 
    "crates"). "imageFile" is an image that will be located 
    in the html folder of your final build.</p>
</div>
                
<div class="code-block">
    <code class="prettyprint lang-javascript">
        <h4>function hasGravity(gravity:number = 9):GameObject</h4>
    </code>
    <p>Applies a gravitation pull on an object. 
        This is completely optional and the value 
        you wish to apply is your choice too.</p>
</div>

<div class="code-block">
    <code><h4>hasWeapon(weapon:Weapon)</h4></code>
    <p>Gives a weapon to the gameobject.</p>
    <p>weapon: the weapon that the object is to have.</p>
</div>

<div class="code-block">
    <code class="prettyprint lang-javascript">
        <h4>function collidesWith(name:string):GameObject</h4>
    </code>
    <p>Used to create a list of game objects that you would like this game object to collide with.</p>
</div>

<div class="code-block">
    <code class="prettyprint lang-javascript"><h4>function collidesWithAll(objectType:string):GameObject</h4></code>
    <p>Similar to the collidesWith function, but works on all types of a particular object.</p>
</div>

<div class="code-block">
    <code class="prettyprint lang-javascript">
        <h4>function positionAt(x:number, y:number):GameObject</h4>
    </code>
    <p>Sets the GameObject's position.</p>
    <p>x: the x-position to place the GameObject</p>
    <p>y: the y-position to place the GameObject</p>
</div>
