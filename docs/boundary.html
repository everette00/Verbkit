<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>Boundaries define areas in the game that cannot be passed. They are the walls,
    ceilings, floors and other similar objects in your game.
    The logic for how boundaries work is split across several classes, all of which
    don't do anything other than push objects in some direction.</p>
 
<h3>Classes</h3>
<div class="code-block">

<div class="code-block">
    <h3>Wall</h3>
    <p>Walls are designed to push an object horizontally if it comes into contact
        with it. You use a wall like this:</p>
     <code>
         // index.ts <br/>
         // place a wall at (0, 0) with a dimensions of 64x200 pixels.
         level("world-one").hasWall(0, 0, 64, 200);<br/>
     </code>
     
</div>

<div class="code-block">
    <h3>Ceiling</h3>
    <p>Ceilings push objects downards when they come into contact with them.</p>
    <code>
        // index.ts <br/>
        // place a ceiling at (0, 0) with a dimensions of 200x64 pixels.
        level("world-one").hasWall(0, 0, 200, 64);<br/>
    </code>
</div>

<div class="code-block">
    <h3>Floor</h3>
    <p>Floors push objects upwards.</p>
    <code>
        // index.ts <br/>
        // place a floor at (0, 400) with a dimensions of 200x64 pixels.
        level("world-one").hasWall(0, 400, 200, 64);<br/>
    </code>
</div>

<div class="code-block">
    <h3>Platform</h3>
    <p>Platforms work similar to floors, but with some minor tweaks to the way its
        logic works.</p>
    <code>
        // index.ts <br/>
        // place a platform at (120, 230) with a dimensions of 64x8 pixels.
        level("world-one").hasWall(120, 230, 64, 8);<br/>
    </code>
</div>

<div class="code-block">
    <h3>Door</h3>
    <p>Doors push in all directions and are meant to be disabled for passage.
        You can set this up by any way you'd like.</p>
     <code>
        // index.ts <br/>
        // place a door at (120, 230) with a dimensions of 16x32 pixels.
        level("world-one").hasWall(120, 230, 16, 32);<br/>
    </code>
